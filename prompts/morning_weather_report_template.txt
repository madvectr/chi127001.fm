1. Give me the morning weather report for the city of Chicago today. 
2. Instead of giving a standard report try to explain the weather as you would see it outside based on the conditions defined in the weather report. 
3. Ensure that you do so without specifying any of the numerical details. 
4. Ensure that you are describing the weather in an artistic manner.
